# CIE_LCS
O'Rourke & Hilley (2023) - "Specifying Conditional Indirect Effects in Latent Change Score Mediation Models with Time-Invariant Moderators"

This repository stores files for the paper named above. Data were simulated with the "CIE LCS data gen.R" file. "CIELCS_constr.dat" and "CIELCS_mg.dat" are the data files to be used with Mplus. Mplus .inp files have "Wald" or "Bootstrap" suffixes to denote which test is conducted in the script but are otherwise identical. Mplus .inp file suffixes are interpreted as follows:

"mg" = multiple group model

"cov" = time-invariant covariate model

"constr" = constrained coupling across time

"free" = freely estimated coupling across time
