# CIE_LCS
O'Rourke &amp; Hilley (2023) data generation and results

Data were simulated with the "CIE LCS data gen.R" file

"CIELCS_constr.dat" and "CIELCS_mg.dat" are the data files to be used with Mplus

Mplus .inp files have "Wald" or "Bootstrap" suffixes to denote which test is conducted in the script but are otherwise identical

Mplus .inp file suffixes are interpreted as follows:

"mg" = multiple group model

"cov" = time-invariant covariate model

"constr" = constrained coupling across time

"free" = freely estimated coupling across time
