O'Rourke & Hilley (2024) - "A Guide to Specifying Effects in Latent Change Score Models with Moderated Mediation in Mplus"

This repository stores files for the paper named above. Data were simulated with the "CIE LCS data gen.R" file. "CIELCS_constr.dat" and "CIELCS_mg.dat" are the data files to be used with Mplus. Mplus .inp files have "Wald" or "Bootstrap" suffixes to denote which test is conducted in the script but are otherwise identical. Mplus .inp file suffixes are interpreted as follows:

"mg" = multiple group model (supplemental to paper)

"cov" = time-invariant covariate approach (shown in paper)

"constr" = constrained coupling across time

"free" = freely estimated coupling across time
